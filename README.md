# console-quiz

Created a console quiz as part of Udemy Complete JavaScript Course 2020.

app.js - This is my first attempt at building the quiz - it works! 

View by visiting https://jillglass.github.io/console-quiz/ and selecting 'inspect' from your right click menu, then the 'console' tab.  Refresh the page to get a new question.

My refactored code is saved in app1.js.  I didn't have to refactor too much, just cleaned up the numbering and looped through the answers instead of console logging each one.
